# Ship Battle Simulation for RL agents training
This project is a fully JS-based game of ship battle for my introduction to RL course. 
The game is simple, both players (blue and red) have a fleet of ships (which can be different to make the RL more interesting). 
The map is a sea with some random islands that you need to avoid. 
Students are required to develop an RL agent that will play the game. 
There are no rules, one can decide to be an all-knowing agent with control over all the fleet while others can make a multi-agent with local information (maybe the ships can share their info?)
